          <p>My Software Engineering/Software Developer journey 
            began in 2014 with the typical 'Hello World' program.  
            It was my first line of code in Java.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            From there, I went on to learn some C#, Python, Javascript,
            TypeScript and more.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In 2017, I went through my first bootcamp with a company called TechFleet. 
            While the experience was informative, it did not result in a Software Engineer or Developer position.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            In July of 2022, I was once again provided an opportunity to attend a coding bootcamp.  
            This time, it was with PerScholas, the same company I used to obtain my A+ certification in 2015.
            My 15 weeks at PerScholas did indeed land me a Software Engineer Aprenticeship!

              <p>In 2019, I became a Verizon Certified Scrum Master.  Through that training
                I was introduced to the world of Agile and what it means to be a servant leader.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For the next 3 years, I was more aware of determining story points,
                determining which stories should be included in a sprint, and how to properly structure 
                user stories.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In March of 2022 I became an Certified Scrum Master through Scrum Alliance.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In November of 2022 I was provided the opportunity to become an apprentice to a team of 
                Scrum Masters for a Fortune 100 company. I am looking forward to expanding my practical knowledge and experience
                in this promising field as a Servant Leader.

            <p>As a graduate of Independence High School's class of 1995, I am a product of the Columbus
              City School system.  I lettered in Track, Drill Team and choir.  Had the honor of singing for Mr. Bill Cosby
              and interned at Deshler Elementary School. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I graduated from Penn Foster College in 2009 with an Associates in Criminal Justice while working full 
              time for the State of Ohio.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              In 2014 I obtained my Bachelors in Psychology from Ohio Christian University with a solid 3.5 GPA. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              My hobbies include coding (seriously, its relaxing), travel, and exposing the world to 
              technology and AfroPino Culture through my networking group - AfroPino Vibes.
